Remarkably, there exists no dedicated biographical dictionary on this subject in Chinese, Japanese, or Western languages. While the BDOC does not purport to be comprehensive, it endeavors to elucidate the structure of the Japanese occupation state in China through the diverse biographical pathways of its key figures. Each entry, besides internal cross-references within the BDOC, provides hyperlinks to external online resources, such as the Biographical Dictionary of the International Labor Movement (often referred to as the "Maitron"), the Biographical Dictionary of Republican China (colloquially known as the "Boorman"), and the Historical Dictionary of Japan.</p>

The main focus of the collection is devoted to the immediate post-Maoist period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when dozens of millions of "unjust cases" were revised in the People's Republic of China under the new leadership around Hua Guofeng, Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang. Today, over 5,000 documents of the collection have been annotated and digitized for further research Due to privacy laws, currently the vast majority of individual case files cannot be made available in digitized format.</p>

It mainly consists of journals but also includes a limited number of monographs. The collection shows how unofficial poetry accommodates various marginalized groups in China, including "avant-garde" poets, precarious workers, and members of the queer community. Some of the titles also contain other genres than poetry. The collection also contains some early unofficial publications from the high-socialist period.</p>

It provides users the tools to discover where every Christian church, school, hospital, orphanage, publishing house, and the like were located in China, and it documents who worked inside those buildings, both foreign and Chinese. Collectively, this information creates spatial maps and generates relational networks that reveal where, when, and how Western ideas, technologies, and practices entered China. Simultaneously, it uncovers how and through whom Chinese ideas, technologies, and practices were conveyed to the West.</p>

It provides historians with a bird's-eye view on a collection of gazetteers beyond browsing and reading individually. The philosophy behind LoGaRT is to treat all the digitized gazetteers available as a conceptual database for historical inquiries. Thus, LoGaRT allows historians to ask larger-scale questions that are not necessarily bounded by geographical regions, time periods, or individual efforts. There are many collections of digitized Chinese local gazetteers with differing quality and licensing conditions. Currently, two high-quality collections are accessible via LoGaRT: Rare Local Gazetteers at Harvard-Yenching Library and Erudition's Zhongguo fangzhi ku (中国方志库).</p>

Our project includes maps, datasets, and studies on China's international engagement, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Our resources compile information from a variety of credible sources, which range from the Reconnecting Asia Project Database to the Hong Kong Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Hong Kong, AIDDATA GeoQuery, the Boston University Global China Dataset, the Australian Strategic Policy/International Cyber Policy Center, and projects compiled by NYU Shanghai.

The purpose of MCGD is to identify and collect all the name variants under which locations in China were named in historical sources. In particular, this includes the amazing variety of transliteration systems through which Westerners designated place names (e.g. for Shanghai: Shang-hae, Changhaï, Schanghai, etc.). The MCGS Search interface can be used to identify and locate place names. User can search place name individually or they can upload a list of place names as a CSV file. The search engine will retrieve any name, in Chinese or any transliteration system, and provide the geo-coordinates, along with the current name in Chinese and pinyin, as well as all known designations.</p>

        <h6>Background</h6>
<p>The field of China studies faces a growing set of challenges. State censorship, heighted geopolitical tensions, and the lasting effects of the pandemic have exacerbated longstanding barriers to research at a moment when scholarship on China has never been more crucial. With the support of the Henry Luce Foundation, ACLS has been working closely with scholars, experts, and practitioners in China studies to study impactful interventions that respond to the collective needs of the field. Building on these collaborative efforts, the Luce/ACLS Program in China Studies in 2024 launched the China Digital Archives Mapping Project to organize support for scholars and institutions engaged in research amid a uniquely challenging environment. The initiative is part of the Luce/ACLS Program in China Studies, which recently received a $3 million extension grant from the Henry Luce Foundation to support this and related initiatives through 2028. </p>

<p>Building on the Open Database Resource Guide released in September 2024, the Mapping Project website hosts a searchable directory of more than 65 repositories that offer free access to large primary source sets for China studies research. The directory also features additional collection information and metadata that can be downloaded as a full data set. To affiliate access for under-resourced scholars, the website provides a list of library partners at leading university libraries who offer walk-in service to researchers without affiliation Future updates include a new section of articles, tutorials, and templates detailing digital workflows for researchers and data librarians to be launched in the next year.</p>

<h6>Credits</h6>
<p>The Mapping Project website was built by Special Projects Researcher JM Chris Chang in close consultation with technology advisor Marii Nyrop, the Senior Research Data Engineer at NYU Libraries. Morgan Day, ACLS Program Coordinator for International Programs, provided art direction. The directory incorporates material from the Open Database Resource Guide, a curated guide to open access databases which was edited by Joshua Seufert (Princeton University Libraries) and Luo Zhou (Duke University Libraries). The template for the Airtable database that maintains the directory was originated by Paula Curtis, currently Operations Leader of Japan Past & Present.</p>

<h6>The American Council of Learned Societies</h6>
<p>Formed a century ago, the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) is a nonprofit federation of 81 scholarly organizations. As the leading representative of American scholarship in the humanities and interpretive social sciences, ACLS upholds the core principle that knowledge is a public good. In supporting its member organizations, ACLS expands the forms, content, and flow of scholarly knowledge, reflecting our commitment to diversity of identity and experience. ACLS collaborates with institutions, associations, and individuals to strengthen the evolving infrastructure for scholarship.</p>

<h6><The Henry Luce Foundation</h6>
<p>The Henry Luce Foundation seeks to deepen knowledge and understanding in pursuit of a more democratic and just world. Established in 1936 by Henry R. Luce, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of Time, Inc., the Luce Foundation advances its mission by nurturing knowledge communities and institutions, fostering dialogue across divides, enriching public discourse, amplifying diverse voices, and investing in leadership development.</p>

<h6>DESCRIPTION</h6>
CUA is an online repository of works by PRC-based individuals who produce independent magazines, books, and documentary films. These works seek to challenge the government's monopolistic vision of the past by offering new interpretations of Chinese history based on different political, ethnic, or gender perspectives. Launched in late 2023, the archive holds more than 850 such items. They are offered free as open-access downloads. Each item has a bilingual introduction explaining its significance and are searchable by tags based on creator, era, topic, and format.

<h6>DESCRIPTION</h6>
The Chinese Iconography Thesaurus (CIT) is designed as both an indexing standard and image archive for Chinese iconography. The CIT terminology uses a corpus of historical catalogue records and inscriptions on art objects (e.g. Shiqu baoji and Midian zhulin) as the primary source. The CIT terminology consists of general terms (e.g. plants, animals, people, objects, events), proper names (e.g. names of persons and places in Chinese history, religion, mythology or literature), and terms describing motifs, subjects and themes.

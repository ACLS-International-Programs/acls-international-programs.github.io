<h6>DESCRIPTION</h6>
Unofficial poetry publications from China, collected by Maghiel van Crevel. This unofficial poetry is hugely influential but difficult to access. To address this paradox and advance research, teaching, and use by the general reader, Leiden University Libraries has digitized large parts of the collection and made this material freely accessible online.The collection contains early specimens from the late 1970s and extends to the early 21st century. It mainly consists of journals but also includes a limited number of monographs. The collection shows how unofficial poetry accommodates various marginalized groups in China, including "avant-garde" poets, precarious workers, and members of the queer community. Some of the titles also contain other genres than poetry. The collection also contains some early unofficial publications from the high-socialist period.

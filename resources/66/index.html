<h6>DESCRIPTION</h6>
The Mapping Global China project is designed to offer a distinctive view of China's global economic endeavors through data-driven analysis and research. Our project includes maps, datasets, and studies on China's international engagement, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Our resources compile information from a variety of credible sources, which range from the Reconnecting Asia Project Database to the Hong Kong Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Hong Kong, AIDDATA GeoQuery, the Boston University Global China Dataset, the Australian Strategic Policy/International Cyber Policy Center, and projects compiled by NYU Shanghai. Each project is connected to satellite imagery that allows users to examine the transformation of areas before and after project development.

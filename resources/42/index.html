<h6>DESCRIPTION</h6>
The mission of the World Historical Gazetteer is to build a platform for open linked historical place data in order to foster deeper understanding of place history and to improve discovery of places that have had many names over time. The WHG place index is accessible through tools and services that permit users to search and browse information about places, augment and contribute their own place records, assemble and publish information about places, and use information about places in teaching and communication.

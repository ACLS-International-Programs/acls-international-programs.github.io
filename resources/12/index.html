<h6>DESCRIPTION</h6>
The Chinese Christian Texts Database (CCT-database) is a referential research database of primary and secondary sources concerning the cultural contacts between China and Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (from 1582 to ca. 1840). The database provides the detailed description of ca. 1.050 Chinese and ca. 4.000 European primary sources from that period. There are over 11.000 secondary sources, which, if applicable, are linked to the primary sources. Extensive searches can be made in the whole database, or in the primary or secondary sources separately. As much as possible the data are linked to the original sources, in so far these appear on public websites.

<h6>DESCRIPTION</h6>
This collaborative project makes available translations (from Chinese to English) of portions of the 明史 Mingshi, or the Official History of the Ming Dynasty. The Mingshi was presented to the Qing throne in 1736 and published in 1739. Compiled from materials collected over the course of the Ming period (1368-1644) and thereafter, it contains valuable information on Ming government, society, and prominent individuals. The site also provides translations from other sources on Ming, and other resources.

<h6>DESCRIPTION</h6>
The People's Map of Global China tracks China's complex and rapidly changing international activities. Drawing on the expertise of researchers and civil society organisations from across the world, this open access and interactive archive provides in-depth and grounded knowledge about China's global imprint that reflects the ever-evolving nature of China's international engagements. The map consists of profiles of countries and projects, sortable by project parameters, Chinese companies and banks involved, and their social, political, and environmental impacts.

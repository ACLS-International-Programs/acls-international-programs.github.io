<h6>DESCRIPTION</h6>
The Maoist Legacy Collection at the University of Freiburg holds several thousand original documents, handbooks, and personal dossiers from the 1950s until the 1980s. It ranks among the most comprehensive collections worldwide on the question of how a communist dictatorship has attempted to address injustices and atrocities committed in its own name. The main focus of the collection is devoted to the immediate post-Maoist period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when dozens of millions of "unjust cases" were revised in the People's Republic of China under the new leadership around Hua Guofeng, Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang. Today, over 5,000 documents of the collection have been annotated and digitized for further research Due to privacy laws, currently the vast majority of individual case files cannot be made available in digitized format.

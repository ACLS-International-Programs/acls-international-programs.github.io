<h2>RESOURCES FOR CHINA STUDIES</h2>
<p>The China Studies Digital Archives Mapping Project is an ongoing initiative that aims to expand access to primary materials and source collections that are vital to the advancement of the China Studies field. The Mapping Project coordinates researchers, librarians, and database administrators from a range of institutions to enhance access and discoverability for existing repositories and support the development of new digital resources.

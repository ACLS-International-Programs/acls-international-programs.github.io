description: The Biographical Dictionary of Occupied China (BDOC) seeks to address
  a significant lacuna in the scholarship surrounding the Japanese occupation of China
  (1937-1945). Remarkably, there exists no dedicated biographical dictionary on this
  subject in Chinese, Japanese, or Western languages. While the BDOC does not purport
  to be comprehensive, it endeavors to elucidate the structure of the Japanese occupation
  state in China through the diverse biographical pathways of its key figures. Each
  entry, besides internal cross-references within the BDOC, provides hyperlinks to
  external online resources, such as the Biographical Dictionary of the International
  Labor Movement (often referred to as the "Maitron"), the Biographical Dictionary
  of Republican China (colloquially known as the "Boorman"), and the Historical Dictionary
  of Japan.

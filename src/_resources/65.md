description: The People's Map of Global China tracks China's complex and rapidly changing
  international activities. Drawing on the expertise of researchers and civil society
  organisations from across the world, this open access and interactive archive provides
  in-depth and grounded knowledge about China's global imprint that reflects the ever-evolving
  nature of China's international engagements. The map consists of profiles of countries
  and projects, sortable by project parameters, Chinese companies and banks involved,
  and their social, political, and environmental impacts.

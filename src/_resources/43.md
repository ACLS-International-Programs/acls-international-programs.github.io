description: The Chinese Iconography Thesaurus (CIT) is designed as both an indexing
  standard and image archive for Chinese iconography. The CIT terminology uses a corpus
  of historical catalogue records and inscriptions on art objects (e.g. Shiqu baoji
  and Midian zhulin) as the primary source. The CIT terminology consists of general
  terms (e.g. plants, animals, people, objects, events), proper names (e.g. names
  of persons and places in Chinese history, religion, mythology or literature), and
  terms describing motifs, subjects and themes.

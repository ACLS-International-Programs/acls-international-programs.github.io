description: 'The online system of the Archives of the Institute of Modern History
  (AIMH), Academia Sinica, provides readers with catalog search and digital image
  viewing. The documents housed in the Archives can be roughly grouped into five categories:
  Foreign Ministry Collection (1861-2009), Economic Ministry Collection (1903-1980),
  Personal Papers, Other Organizations, and Historical Maps. Half of them have been
  digitized; 60 percent of these digitized items can be directly viewed online through
  this system, while the rest can only be viewed in the on-site reading room.'

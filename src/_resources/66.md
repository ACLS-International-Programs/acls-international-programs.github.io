description: The Mapping Global China project is designed to offer a distinctive view
  of China's global economic endeavors through data-driven analysis and research.
  Our project includes maps, datasets, and studies on China's international engagement,
  such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Our resources compile information from
  a variety of credible sources, which range from the Reconnecting Asia Project Database
  to the Hong Kong Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences at the University
  of Hong Kong, AIDDATA GeoQuery, the Boston University Global China Dataset, the
  Australian Strategic Policy/International Cyber Policy Center, and projects compiled
  by NYU Shanghai. Each project is connected to satellite imagery that allows users
  to examine the transformation of areas before and after project development.

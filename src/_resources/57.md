description: The Chinese Rare Book Digital Collection draws from the 5,300 titles
  of Chinese rare books housed at the Asian Division of the Library of Congress. The
  online presentation includes nearly 2,000 digitized rare titles. The Chinese Rare
  Book Digital Collection includes the most valuable titles and editions housed in
  the Library's Asian Division, some of which date back to the 11th or 12th century
  and are the only extant copies in the world. This new digital collection brings
  together printed books, manuscripts, Buddhist sutras, works with hand-painted pictures,
  local gazetteers, and ancient maps.

description: MCBD is a freely accessible relational database that aims at recording
  all the historical actors active in China in the Late Qing and Republican periods
  (1830--1949), regardless of their origin, nationality and the duration of their
  presence in China. MCBD currently holds data on more than 75,000 individuals, with
  information on 20,000 positions and 6,000 curricula/degrees, as well as 10,000 institutions
  and 14,000 companies. A major feature of MCBD is to present individuals under all
  the forms their name took, both in Chinese and in all sorts of transliterations
  in Western-language sources.

description: The mission of the World Historical Gazetteer is to build a platform
  for open linked historical place data in order to foster deeper understanding of
  place history and to improve discovery of places that have had many names over time.
  The WHG place index is accessible through tools and services that permit users to
  search and browse information about places, augment and contribute their own place
  records, assemble and publish information about places, and use information about
  places in teaching and communication.

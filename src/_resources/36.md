description: The Chinese Religious Text Authority (CRTA) provides reliable bibliographic
  and academic information about Chinese religious texts, focusing on texts produced
  prior to 1949. The Chinese Religious Text Authority aims to connect bibliographic
  information across collections, archives, and private libraries in order to map
  out detailed webs of relationships among producers, publishers, and distributors
  of religious texts. In this first phase of the project, we focus on a corpus of
  pre-1949 Chinese Religious texts included in major reprint collections. The data
  generated from this open-access, international, collaborative project has the potential
  to reveal formerly undiscovered associations.

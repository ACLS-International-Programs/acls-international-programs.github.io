description: BDRC developed the Buddhist Digital Archives (BUDA) as a collaborative
  platform for Buddhist texts in order to benefit the Buddhist community and BDRC's
  many users in academia. With new features and an innovative design, BUDA greatly
  improves access to a vast collection of Tibetan Buddhist works, as well as to collections
  of Sanskrit, Chinese, Pali, Burmese, and Khmer materials. It is open source and
  as open access as possible. Resources are made available by both BDRC and its partner
  collections.

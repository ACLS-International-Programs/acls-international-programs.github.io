description: The Chinese Christian Texts Database (CCT-database) is a referential
  research database of primary and secondary sources concerning the cultural contacts
  between China and Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (from 1582
  to ca. 1840). The database provides the detailed description of ca. 1.050 Chinese
  and ca. 4.000 European primary sources from that period. There are over 11.000 secondary
  sources, which, if applicable, are linked to the primary sources. Extensive searches
  can be made in the whole database, or in the primary or secondary sources separately.
  As much as possible the data are linked to the original sources, in so far these
  appear on public websites.

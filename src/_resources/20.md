description: Until the end of the first half of the last century, there existed between
  the cities of Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau, a constant sharing of authors, cross-border
  advertisements, overlapping distribution networks and common cultural icons. By
  building on the works of previous researchers and librarians, we have collected
  information about popular periodicals stored in various databases, libraries in
  Hong Kong, Macau and the United Kingdom and private collections to put together
  the 80 entries found on this site and which together offer a rich expression of
  a 'Cantonese cultural region'.

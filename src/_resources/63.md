description: CHMap provides quick access to 4,088 land survey maps of China produced
  by either China's central and provincial governments or the land survey department
  of the Japanese Army during the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. They are
  the first maps that provide accurate and large-scale outlooks (1:50,000) to a wide
  geography of proper China. In CHMap, users can access these land survey maps digitized
  by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and hosted at Max Planck Institute for the History
  of Science, as well as those hosted at Academia Sinica.

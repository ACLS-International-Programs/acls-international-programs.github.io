description: 'The Xinjiang Documentation Project is a multi-disciplinary research
  project based at the Institute for Asian Research in the School of Public Policy
  and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia and the Gender, Sexuality,
  and Women''s Studies Department at Simon Fraser University. The Project collects,
  preserves, assesses, and makes available documentary information on the extrajudicial
  detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
  Region, Northwestern China. Our scope and priorities are: making key documents available,
  assessing their reliability, presenting the material for the general public, and
  giving a platform to share the lived experiences, providing regular updates on the
  ongoing situation in the region, and organizing periodic speaker series.'

description: This oral history collection has 739 interviews of survivors of the Great
  Famine that devastated rural China between 1958 and 1961. Officially known in China
  as the "Three Years of Natural Disasters" or "The Difficult Three-Year Period,"
  the Great Famine caused the death of between 20 and 43 million people. More recently
  the project has also covered the Great Leap Forward of 1958-1960, the Land Reform
  and the Collectivization of 1949-1953, the Four Cleanups Movement in 1964, and the
  Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976.

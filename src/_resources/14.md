description: The Ming Qing Women's Writings digital archive and database project is
  dedicated to the digitization of collections of writings by women in late imperial
  China (1368-1911). The website was launched in 2005. The on-going project employs
  new digital technology to preserve and make accessible on the internet this valuable
  cultural legacy for future generations of scholars, researchers, and other interested
  publics, thus building intellectual and technological infrastructure and creating
  possibilities to generate new methodologies in the fields of digital humanities
  and China studies. The website consists of a virtual library augmented by the online
  scholarly apparatus designed and implemented by the McGill Library Digital Initiatives
  team. In addition, it features a link for each writer to the China Biographical
  Database hosted at Harvard University.

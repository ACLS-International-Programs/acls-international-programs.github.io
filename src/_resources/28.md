description: Unofficial poetry publications from China, collected by Maghiel van Crevel.
  This unofficial poetry is hugely influential but difficult to access. To address
  this paradox and advance research, teaching, and use by the general reader, Leiden
  University Libraries has digitized large parts of the collection and made this material
  freely accessible online.The collection contains early specimens from the late 1970s
  and extends to the early 21st century. It mainly consists of journals but also includes
  a limited number of monographs. The collection shows how unofficial poetry accommodates
  various marginalized groups in China, including "avant-garde" poets, precarious
  workers, and members of the queer community. Some of the titles also contain other
  genres than poetry. The collection also contains some early unofficial publications
  from the high-socialist period.

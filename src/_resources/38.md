description: The China Historical Christian Database (CHCD) quantifies and visualizes
  the place of Christianity in modern China (1550-1950). It provides users the tools
  to discover where every Christian church, school, hospital, orphanage, publishing
  house, and the like were located in China, and it documents who worked inside those
  buildings, both foreign and Chinese. Collectively, this information creates spatial
  maps and generates relational networks that reveal where, when, and how Western
  ideas, technologies, and practices entered China. Simultaneously, it uncovers how
  and through whom Chinese ideas, technologies, and practices were conveyed to the
  West.

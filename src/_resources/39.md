description: 'The Max Planck Institute: LoGaRT is a software for searching, analyzing,
  and collecting data from digitized Chinese local gazetteers. It provides historians
  with a bird''s-eye view on a collection of gazetteers beyond browsing and reading
  individually. The philosophy behind LoGaRT is to treat all the digitized gazetteers
  available as a conceptual database for historical inquiries. Thus, LoGaRT allows
  historians to ask larger-scale questions that are not necessarily bounded by geographical
  regions, time periods, or individual efforts. There are many collections of digitized
  Chinese local gazetteers with differing quality and licensing conditions. Currently,
  two high-quality collections are accessible via LoGaRT: Rare Local Gazetteers at
  Harvard-Yenching Library and Erudition''s Zhongguo fangzhi ku (中国方志库).'

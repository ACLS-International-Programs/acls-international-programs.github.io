<p>The field of China studies faces a growing set of challenges. State censorship, heighted geopolitical tensions, and the lasting effects of the pandemic have exacerbated longstanding barriers to research at a moment when scholarship on China has never been more crucial. With the support of the Henry Luce Foundation, ACLS has been working closely with scholars, experts, and practitioners in China studies to study impactful interventions that respond to the collective needs of the field. Building on these collaborative efforts, the Luce/ACLS Program in China Studies in 2024 launched the China Digital Archives Mapping Project to organize support for scholars and institutions engaged in research amid a uniquely challenging environment.</p>
<p>The directory contains a searchable and downloadable guide to open access databases for China studies research. We provide a list of access partners at leading university libraries to offer walk-in service to researchers without affiliation. This website will be updated frequently.</p>
<p>The China Studies Digital Archives Mapping Project website was built by Special Projects Researcher JM Chris Chang with support from the Mapping Projectâ€™s Technology Advisor Marii Nyrop, Senior Research Data Engineer at NYU Libraries, and Morgan Day, ACLS Program Coordinator for International Programs.</p>
<p>The Mapping Project is an ongoing initiative that aims to expand access to primary materials and source collections that are vital to the advancement of the China Studies field. The Mapping Project coordinates researchers, librarians, and database administrators from a range of institutions to enhance access and discoverability for existing repositories and support the development of new digital resources. The directory contains a searchable and downloadable guide to open access databases for China studies research. We provide a list of access partners at leading university libraries to offer walk-in service to researchers without affiliation. This website will be updated frequently.</p>

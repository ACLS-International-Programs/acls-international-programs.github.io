<h6>Background</h6>
<p>The field of China studies faces a growing set of challenges. State censorship, heighted geopolitical tensions, and the lasting effects of the pandemic have exacerbated longstanding barriers to research at a moment when scholarship on China has never been more crucial. With the support of the Henry Luce Foundation, ACLS has been working closely with scholars, experts, and practitioners in China studies to study impactful interventions that respond to the collective needs of the field. Building on these efforts, ACLS launched the China Digital Mapping Project in 2024 to organize support for scholars and institutions engaged in research amid a uniquely challenging environment. The initiative is funded by a $3 million extension grant from the Henry Luce Foundation to support the Luce/ACLS Program in China Studies through 2028. </p>

<p>In May 2024, ACLS convened a working group of leadings China studies librarians to study a cross-institutional framework for common access and and resource-sharing. One of the outcomes of this meeting was the creation of the <a href="https://www.acls.org/resources/open-databases-for-china-studies-resource-guide/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Database Resource Guide</a>, edited by <a href="https://library.princeton.edu/about/staff-directory/joshua-seufert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Seufert</a> (Princeton University Libraries) and <a href="https://directory.library.duke.edu/staff/luo.zhou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luo Zhou</a> (Duke University Libraries). The Mapping Project website builds on this work by providing a searchable directory of repositories with additional collection information that will be expanded over time. The website also offers a list of library partners at university libraries with significant China studies collections who offer walk-in service to researchers without affiliation. Future updates include a new section of articles, tutorials, and templates detailing digital workflows for researchers and data librarians to be launched in the next year.</p>
    
<p>The Mapping Project website was built by ACLS Special Projects Researcher JM Chris Chang with expert assistance from <a href="https://marii.info"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marii Nyrop</a> the Senior Research Data Engineer at NYU Libraries. Morgan Day, ACLS Program Coordinator for International Programs, provided art direction. The template for the Airtable database that maintains the directory was originated by <a href="https://prcurtis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paula Curtis</a>.</p>
